# Welcome to My Profile! 🎉👋

Hey there! 🎉 You’ve just stumbled upon my GitHub profile repository, where I share a little bit about myself.

I'm Yamil Serrano, a tech enthusiast and aspiring software engineer from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez. This space is a cozy hub for all my passions programming, electronics, robotics, and a bit of game development. Whether it’s coding, tinkering with hardware, or creating cool games, you’ll find it all here! ☕️

I speak English and Spanish, so don't be surprised if some lines of code are commented in Spanish and others in English! 😄

Feel free to dive in and explore my skills, projects, and all the exciting things I’m working on. Whether you’re here to collaborate, learn, or just say hi, I’m thrilled to connect and work on something amazing together! 🚀
## 🔧 Skills:

- Simple modeling in fusion 360
- Game Development: I’ve made my own games using the Raylib framework, learning the ins and outs of 2D game design and development.
